   * @brief	Bounding boxes for a model. Even though the loading logic is similar
   * 			to that of the Model class, BoundingBoxes is a separate class with
   * 			a separate loading function, because it loads a Wavefront file
   * 			exported with a different set of options (see README.md).
   * 			Each BoundingBoxes class may contain more than one bounding boxes,
   *                    which means that it is a set of bounding boxes. These are
   * 			not separated into different structures because each has a set of
   * 			six faces and this fact can be used to separate them at runtime.
